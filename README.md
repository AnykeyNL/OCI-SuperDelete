## WORK_IN_PROGRESS
This script is continuously being maintained based on newly released services. If you are noticing this script is missing a particulair service, please let us know, so we can add this.

This script has being massive overhauled in January/February 2022. Instead of having a complete python module for each service, most services are now being deleted via the AnyDelete method included in this script.

The KMS Vaults and Keys can not instantly be deleted, but require a minimal 7 day grace period. The script will move all keys and vaults to the root compartment and will schedule the deletion with 7 days grace period. This will allow all sub compartments to be instantly deleted, while the top compartment will only be able to be deleted after the grace period. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this script is to remove all resources from a compartment, including subcompartments. In OCI you can only remove a compartment when it contains no more resources, but it can be a challenge to find all the resources tied to a compartment. 

This script will hunt for all resources in a compartment and delete/terminate/retire them.

## TODO
Currently this script only support authentication via config file. Plan is to add instance principle support and cloud shell authentication support.
